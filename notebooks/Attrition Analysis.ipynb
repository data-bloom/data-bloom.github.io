    "The data contains \n",
    "* Attrition -- Label attribute (predicted variable)\n",
    "* Age -- Continuous variable  (are older employees more likely to attrite than younger employees?)\n",
    "* Business Travel -- Frequency of travel; are road-warriors more likely to attrite than others?\n",
    "* Daily Rate -- Are compensated employees more satisfied?\n",
    "* Department -- does the field of employment make a difference?\n",
    "* Distance from Home -- is long haul commute a likely indicator for employee frustration?\n",
    "* Education level -- An ordinal rating for level of education. Is education offering better opportunities to lure employees away?\n",
    "* Education Field -- Is academic field an indicator for market appetite of skills?\n",
    "* Employee Count -- duh -- a count of 1 employee is 1. Please ignore this attribute.\n",
    "* Employee Number -- Employee ID; ignore since this is a apriori ID and has no bearing on the unless an employee attrites because they do not like their number. More likely this is an ID attribute and deserves to be thrown out.\n",
    "* Environment Satisfaction -- A score for employee satisfaction from previous survey -- the company's environment in general. Of course, higher the satisfaction, the lesser the attrition.\n",
    "* Gender -- is gender likely a factor? Does gender contribute to churn/volatile qualities?\n",
    "* Hourly Rate -- Are compensated employees more satisfied? This is of course redundant in view of the daily rate and monthly rate. How do we consolidate all these measures of the compensation into a singular attribute?\n",
    "* Job Involvement -- How hands on are the employees? Are involved employees more satisfied?\n",
    "* Job Level -- do executives face different pressures that forces involuntary attrition?\n",
    "* Job Role -- Does title make a difference? This is probably redundant considering department and the job title; but albeit let us keep it in analysis\n",
    "* Job Satisfaction -- past satisfaction score from survey about their specific job. I guess this factor can be confounded with environment satisfaction because it is hard to isolate one's job from company overall.\n",
    "* MaritalStatus -- Do single individuals more likely to attritte because of the socio-econo-emotional independence?\n",
    "* Monthly Income -- How is this different than monthly rate or daily rate or hourly rate? Not sure. Let us leave it in.\n",
    "* Monthly Rate --  -- Are compensated employees more satisfied? This is of course redundant in view of the daily rate and hourly rate. How do we consolidate all these measures of the compensation into a singular attribute?\n",
    "* NumCompaniesWorked -- how many companies in the past have employees rotated? This is meaningless unless we also take into account the total experience duration into account.\n",
    "* Over18 -- is the employee an adult? All employees are adults. So it is best to ignore because this attribute is poorly ranked.\n",
    "* OverTime -- is the employee exempt or eligible for overtime. I suppose exempt employees are fulltime and therefore less likely to attrite than those that rely on variable/non-exempt compensation.\n",
    "* PercentSalaryHike -- hike in percentage during last performance check-in.\n",
    "* PerformanceRating -- was employee rated failing, mediocre, or stellar?\n",
    "* Relationship Satisfaction -- score from last satisfaction survey wrt to relationship with the team.\n",
    "* StandardHours -- # of hours. All values are 80; so it is best to ignore this attribute.\n",
    "* StockOptionLevel -- Stock grant issued during last review.\n",
    "* TotalWorkingYears -- Total years of experience. Is maturity, mid-life crisis, old age a factor in attrition?\n",
    "* TrainingTimesLastYear -- how much time did employee spend training on new skills last year. Is the academic pursuit and passion still existent in the employee?\n",
    "* WorkLifeBalance -- is there a good work-life balance? Higher is better.\n",
    "* YearsAtCompany -- how long in the current company have employees stayed?\n",
    "* YearsInCurrentRole -- how long in current role; or other way of saying when did employee last change their role?\n",
    "* YearsSinceLastPromotion -- how long since the employee been promoted?\n",
    "* YearsWithCurrManager -- years under current manager. Indicates a level of comfort with management line.\n"

    "3. Education -- Individuals with doctoral degree do not attrite.\n",

    "5. EmployeeNumber -- is an ID attribute and useless as hypothesized\n",
    "6. All satisfaction scores, as rightly hypothesized, exhibit higher attrition when satisfaction scores are lower. We still need a way to consolidate the three scores into one if possible.\n",

    "14. PercentSalaryHike -- people that received lower raises of course tend to move on.\n",
    "15. Peformance Rating -- people with outstanding performance are recognized and rewarded; therefore attrite less. But we only see employees receiving excellent and outstanding ratings despite a wider range. So we have to renormalize the scale for better representation. Since the rating is already coded an ordinal attribute, we may be ok leaving as is too.\n",
    "16. Lower stock option levels lead to higher attrition.\n",
    "17. TotalWorkingYears -- people with approximately &lt;10 years attrite more. This variable is indeed confounded by age, marital status, experience, and YearsAtCompany perhaps!\n",
    "18. TrainingTimesLastYear -- employees that do not seek training (are too snobby or too unskilled); and ones with 2-3 trainings seem to exhibit churn as skills are either too stale or improved beyond being applicable to current role.\n",
    "19. YearsAtCompany and YearsInCurrentRole -- shorter experience window, especially in the first two years, seems to suggest quick attrition. This is understandable as new roles/employees are disconnected from business and usually take time to familiarize with the organization, business dynamics.\n",
    "20. YearsSinceLastPromotion -- people with relatively long time since recent promotions seem to attrite less; perhaps they are just coasting in the current job.\n",
    "21. YearsWithCurrentManager -- employees develop a trust with management in ~5 years. Before that, the lack of trust perhaps leads to attrition because of a clear alignment with management. Some individuals perhaps seek a change after a long term trust relationship too; so a few attrites do occur at the sixth year."

Btw, in real world, it is more detrimental to safely assume that an employee will not attrite when they do -- and one would want to err towards caution -- therefore be more intolerant to true negatives.\n",
    "* To read a confusion matrix heuristically, if you treat the visualization of a matrix as a matrix, the elements along the diagonal must be large numbers and there should not be any spillage outside the diagonal. Spillage will seep to non diagonal elements which are indication that model and the real-world do not align. So it should be \"dark\" along the diagonal and white along non-diagonals.\n",
